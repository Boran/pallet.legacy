Generate pallet image: stack reels optimally on a pallet
 * With layout of reels for 5 different scenarios
 * Inputs are provided via web parameters.

Uses immagemagick libaby, tested on Ubuntu 12.04

This is a poorly documented custom script, sorry.
A cleaned up version based on Symfony2 will be published on https://github.com/Boran/pallet but the idea is to first publish the simple, original, working release.

 Install
 * Needs to be in /var/www/jobweb/pallet really.
